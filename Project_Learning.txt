## Project: Continuous Delivery Pipeline for Web Application (AWS)

Objective: Built and deployed a full CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js web application using GitHub and AWS services. The pipeline automatically deploys updates whenever the source code is modified.

## Tools & Technologies:

Version Control: GitHub (source code trigger)

CI/CD: AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild

Deployment: AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Infrastructure as Code (optional): AWS CloudFormation (for reusable setups)

## Key Highlights:

Connected GitHub repository to AWS CodePipeline for automatic pipeline triggers on commits.

Configured buildspec.yml to manage dependencies and generate deployable artifacts using CodeBuild.

Integrated AWS Elastic Beanstalk to host and auto-deploy the application on successful builds.

Diagnosed real-world deployment issues such as IAM permission errors and artifact structure problems.

Gained hands-on experience editing S3 bucket policies, IAM roles, and troubleshooting pipeline failures.
